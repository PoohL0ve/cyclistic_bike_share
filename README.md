# Executive Summary: Cyclistic
Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company, sought insights into how their bikes were being used to inform future expansion plans for bike-riding locations. Although the company provided a dataset, it lacked some information necessary for a comprehensive analysis. However, by refining the available data, we were able to extract relevant metrics and dimensions. These insights were then presented through a [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/CyclisticBikeShare_17356144663650/CyclisticBikeShare?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) to assist Cyclistic in making informed decisions.

## Main Findings
The two most interesting facts were that users ride more frequently during the Fall season and the Lower East-side has the highest end-locations out of all the location provided.
