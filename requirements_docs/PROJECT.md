The Cyclistic team want to understand how their customers are using their bikes in order to develop plans for next that includes build new stations.

## Success Criteria
Understanding what success might look like for this project using the SMART framework.
- **Specific**: The BI insights must clearly show metrics that can be used to determine what makes a product successful, how customers are using the bikes, and how stations are being used.
- **Measurable**: Bike trips must be quantifiable based on duration, location, time of day or year.
- **Action-Oriented**: The outsomes from the insights should be used to determine whether factors like time of day, time of year, loccation, or weather has a great impact of bike usage.
- **Relevant**: The metrics must be relevant to the business objectives.
- **Time-bound**: The project should be completed in 6 weeks.

## User Journeys
Use the data provided by Cyclistice to understand what the customers may think about their experience with Cyclistic.

## Assumptions

## Compliance and Privacy
The data must not contain any personal identifying data. It should only be used for analysis based on factors such as *duration*, but not *who* uses it.

## Accessibility
Sara requested that the dashboard be created with large print and text-to-speech alternatives.

## Roll-out-plan
The Cyclistic team would like the dashboard to be completed in 6 weeks, following the plan list below:
- Week 1: Dataset assigned. Initial design for fields and BikeIDs validated to fit the requirements.
- Weeks 2–3: SQL and ETL development
- Weeks 3–4: Finalize SQL. Dashboard design. 1st draft review with peers.
- Weeks 5–6: Dashboard development and testing
